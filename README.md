# Project description: 
We created a dashboard to help real estate owners in New York City to price their properties on Airbnb.
For this reason the first part of this dashboard **"Explore Data!"** is to analyse the market and see how it reacts to different factors like neighbourhood or room type.
If you now have analyzed the market and know which property you want to place on Airbnb or already knew it, the second part **"Price prediction"** helps you with pricing it. Our machine learning algorithm uses a **random forest regressor** to estimate an appropriate market price for your specific property!

In order to deploy the app **directly from a webbrowser**, we used the open source python framework **streamlit**.<br>
